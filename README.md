# Infrastructure as Code
This repo holds the presentation I gave at the SF Automation Meetup in October
2015. The hope for this presentation is that it can be taken and presented to
internal teams to foster deployment and innovation around the IAC problem
space. This repo will allso eventually hold the demo/test bed for the components
mentioned in this presentation.

## Presentation
The presentation requires GO Present.
